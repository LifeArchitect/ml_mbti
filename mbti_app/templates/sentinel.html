        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>You should take a straightforward, direct approach when engaging the Knights. Set the agenda from the start and share about your years of experience in the industry and any certifications you have from authoritative bodies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
        <p>Be prepared and organized with the facts - Knights often request for details of the product and they would like to compare your product to other similar products as well so that they know they're getting the best value for money. To support the value of your product, remember to back up your pitch with statistics, hard data and real life testimonials.</p>

      <div class="">
        <h3>Sales Script</h3>
        <p>Prepare an industry analysis and focus on selling the concept of your product, rather than going into details about your product. Wizards tend to like discussing concepts rather than be bogged down by details. Occasionally, they do ask for details, but it is usually so that they can do their own analysis. Be prepared to be challenged, and explain with logical reason why your product is preferred.</p>
