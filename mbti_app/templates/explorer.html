        <h1>WOOHOO OUR PREDICTION IS "EXPLORER"</h1>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>With the Explorers, you don't have to be too serious. Be friendly, easy-going and casual and make some small talk with them. They're most open to you when things are light and easy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
        <p>During the pitch, keep it short and keep them engaged by having a dialogue. Explorers tend to disengage quickly if they are asked to just sit down and listen to a presentation.  If possible, make the presentation appealing to all the five senses - when they experience a product or service and they like it, nothing much else has to be said. They are already likely to buy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Sales Script</h3>
        <p>Prepare an industry analysis and focus on selling the concept of your product, rather than going into details about your product. Wizards tend to like discussing concepts rather than be bogged down by details. Occasionally, they do ask for details, but it is usually so that they can do their own analysis. Be prepared to be challenged, and explain with logical reason why your product is preferred.</p>
