        <h1>WOOHOO OUR PREDICTION IS "EXPLORER"</h1>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>With the Explorers, you don't have to be too serious. Be friendly, easy-going and casual and make some small talk with them. They're most open to you when things are light and easy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
        <p>During the pitch, keep it short and keep them engaged by having a dialogue. Explorers tend to disengage quickly if they are asked to just sit down and listen to a presentation.  If possible, make the presentation appealing to all the five senses - when they experience a product or service and they like it, nothing much else has to be said. They are already likely to buy.</p>
